# KNN_HYPERTUNE
A UNSUPERVISED MACHINE LEARINING 
Overview
This Jupyter Notebook, knn2_hypertune.ipynb, demonstrates the process of hyperparameter tuning for a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier. The notebook covers the essential steps required to optimize the performance of the KNN algorithm by systematically varying key parameters.

Structure
The notebook is structured as follows:
